## Overview

This repository contains the data and code supporting the study: ["A systematic comparison of natural product potential, with an emphasis on RiPPs, by mining of bacteria of three large ecosystems."](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0888754324001010) 

This study collected a large set of metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems to investigate the biosynthetic potential of these bacteria. We demonstrate the utility of public dataset collections for revealing the different secondary metabolite biosynthetic potentials among these different living environments. We show that there is a higher occurrence of RiPPs in terrestrial systems, while in marine systems, we found relatively more terpene-, NRP-, and PK-encoding gene clusters. Among the many new biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) identified, we analyzed various Nif-11-like and nitrile hydratase leader peptide (NHLP) containing gene clusters that would merit further study, including promising products, such as mersacidin-, LAP-, and proteusin analogs.
